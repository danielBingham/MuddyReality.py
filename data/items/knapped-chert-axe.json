    "details": "This is a knapped chert axe.  The head has been painstakingly knapped to a rough edge. The edge is not very sharp, but with enough force it will cut wood. Against flesh, it would act more as a bludgeon or a scaper.  A rough half meter wood handle has been tied on to the stone using some sort of cordage.  It's not immediately clear what kind.",
